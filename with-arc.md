### **🔄 Troubleshooting Guide**

#### **Common Issue 1: Target Group Shows Unhealthy**
**Symptoms:** Targets remain in "unhealthy" state
**Causes:**
- Security group blocking health check traffic
- Application not responding on health check path
- Health check path doesn't exist

**Solutions:**
1. Verify security group allows HTTP traffic on port 80
2. Check application logs for errors
3. Create `/health` endpoint or use existing path like `/index.html`
4. Adjust health check thresholds (healthy/unhealthy threshold)

#### **Common Issue 2: Auto Scaling Not Triggering**
**Symptoms:** Instances don't scale despite high CPU
**Causes:**
- Scaling policy not attached to ASG
- CloudWatch alarm not configured properly
- Insufficient IAM permissions

**Solutions:**
1. Verify scaling policy is attached to ASG
2. Check CloudWatch alarm state and threshold
3. Ensure EC2 service role has necessary permissions
4. Review scaling activity history in ASG

#### **Common Issue 3: ALB Returns 503 Errors**
**Symptoms:** "503 Service Unavailable" errors
**Causes:**
- No healthy targets in target group
- All instances failing health checks
- Target group not attached to listener

**Solutions:**
